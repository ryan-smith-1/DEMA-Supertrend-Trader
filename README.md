DEMA + SUPERTREND Strategy BTC bot. Built for coinbase but could work with more. 
Current supertrend settings are period of 12 and multiplier of 3

Working Version: working-version.py is the most up to date version of the bot, but could include logic bugs in trading strategy/calculations


Before Running/Installation - 
Set Coinbase REST API keys (The non pro/advanced one), in all three spots. 
pip install all required libraries. 



IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE - 
  1. Create a way to properly backtest the exact strategy being used
 
  3. Adding some sort of RSI index to the buy and sell conditions.
