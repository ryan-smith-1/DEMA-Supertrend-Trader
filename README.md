DEMA + SUPERTREND Strategy BTC bot. Built for coinbase but could work with more. 
Right now it is operating with the supertrend at 1 minute time frame (updating every 1 min) and DEMA at 200 days timeframe. 
Period of 12 and multiplier of 3 for the supertrend settings. 

Improvements to be made - 
Changing the supertrend to a larger timeframe like 15 minutes could help, but should be tested 

Before Running/Installation - 
Set Coinbase REST API keys (The non pro/advanced one), in all three spots. 
pip install all required libraries.
