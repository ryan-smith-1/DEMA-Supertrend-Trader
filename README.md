DEMA + SUPERTREND Strategy BTC bot. Built for coinbase but could work with more. 
Right now there is a version operating with the supertrend at 1 minute time frame (updating every 1 min) and DEMA at 200 days timeframe, and a copy version that is running supertrend at 15 minute time frame. 
Period of 12 and multiplier of 3 for the supertrend settings. 

Working Version: working-version.py is the most up to date version of the bot. Supertrend on 15 minutes timeframe, and supertrend calculation bugs fixed.

Improvements to be made - 
Adding some sort of RSI index to the buy and sell conditions. 

Before Running/Installation - 
Set Coinbase REST API keys (The non pro/advanced one), in all three spots. 
pip install all required libraries.
